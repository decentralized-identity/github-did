In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to set up a GitHub DID using the CLI and a local wallet to manage keys.

### [See the @github-did/cli tutorial](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/github-did/tree/master/packages/cli#github-didcli)

Once you have used the CLI to setup your DID, you are ready to try out the progressive web app demo, and use your web wallet and linked keys to sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt.

Head over to [https://github-did.com/wallet](https://github-did.com/wallet) and import your wallet by following the instructions.

Congrats! You should now have a usable / resolvable DID to experiment with!
