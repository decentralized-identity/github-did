Read the Docs: Documentation Simplified
=======================================

`Read the Docs`_ simplifies software documentation
by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you.
Think of it as *Continuous Documentation*.

Never out of sync
    Whenever you push code to your favorite version control system,
    whether that is Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Subversion,
    Read the Docs will automatically build your docs
    so your code and documentation are always up-to-date.

Multiple versions
    Read the Docs can host and build multiple versions of your docs
    so having a 1.0 version of your docs and a 2.0 version
    of your docs is as easy as having a separate branch or tag in your version control system.

Free and open source
    Read the Docs is free and open source and hosts documentation
    for nearly 100,000 large and small open source projects
    in almost every human and computer language.
